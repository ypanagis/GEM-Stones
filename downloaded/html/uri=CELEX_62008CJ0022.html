         professional activity which is insufficient to ensure its holder a livelihood and which has lasted barely more than one month,
         the possibility cannot be ruled out that that professional activity, following an overall assessment of the employment relationship,
         may be considered by the national authorities as real and genuine, thereby allowing its holder to be granted the status of
         &lsquo;worker&rsquo; within the meaning of Article 39 EC.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">In that regard, the concept of &lsquo;worker&rsquo; within the meaning of Article 39 EC has a specific Community meaning and must not
         be interpreted narrowly. Any person who pursues activities which are real and genuine, to the exclusion of activities on such
         a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary, must be regarded as a &lsquo;worker&rsquo;. The essential feature of
         an employment relationship is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of
         another person in return for which he receives remuneration.

         principle of equal treatment enjoyed by Union citizens other than workers, self-employed persons, persons who retain such
         status and members of their families who reside within the territory of the host Member State provided for in Article 24(2)
         of Directive 2004/38 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory
         of the Member States, amending Regulation No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221, 68/360, 72/194, 73/148, 75/34, 75/35,

         in particular on job-seekers during the longest period during which they have the right to reside there must be interpreted
         in accordance with Article 39(2) EC.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">In that regard, nationals of the Member States seeking employment in another Member State who have established real links
         with the labour market of that State can rely on Article 39(2) EC in order to receive a benefit of a financial nature intended
         to facilitate access to the labour market. It is for the competent national authorities and, where appropriate, the national
         courts not only to establish the existence of a real link with the labour market, but also to assess the constituent elements
         of that benefit, in particular its purposes and the conditions subject to which it is granted. The objective of the benefit
         must be analysed according to its results and not according to its formal structure. Thus, benefits of a financial nature
         which, independently of their status under national law, are intended to facilitate access to the labour market cannot be
         regarded as constituting &lsquo;social assistance&rsquo; within the meaning of Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38.

      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">The first paragraph of Article 12 EC prohibits, within the scope of application of the EC Treaty and without prejudice to
         any provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality. That provision concerns situations coming
         within the scope of Community law in which a national of one Member State suffers discriminatory treatment in relation to
         nationals of another Member State solely on the basis of his nationality and is not intended to apply to cases of a possible

      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point16" shape="rect">16</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Koupatantze, who was born on 15 May 1952, is a Greek national.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point17" shape="rect">17</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered Germany in October 2006 and accepted employment on 1&nbsp;November 2006. His employment contract ended on 21 December
         2006, the employer invoking a shortage of orders.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point18" shape="rect">18</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22 December 2006, Mr Koupatantze applied to the ARGE for basic benefits in favour of job-seekers under the SGB II. By decision
         of the ARGE of 15&nbsp;January 2007, benefits in the amount of EUR 670 per month were granted to him up to 31&nbsp;May 2007. However,
         by decision of 18 April 2007, the ARGE ended payment of those benefits with effect from 28 April 2007.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point19" shape="rect">19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objection filed by Mr Koupatantze against that decision was dismissed by decision of the ARGE of 11 May 2007, on the ground
         that he was not entitled to benefits under point 2 of the second sentence of Paragraph 7(1) of the SGB II. Mr&nbsp;Koupatantze
         appealed against that decision to the referring court.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point20" shape="rect">20</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 1 June 2007, Mr Koupatantze again took up a professional activity which allowed him to be no longer dependent on social
         assistance.

      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>The questions referred for preliminary ruling</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point21" shape="rect">21</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18 December 2007, the Sozialgericht N&uuml;rnberg decided to stay the respective proceedings and to refer the following questions
         to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling:
      </p>
      <p class="C09Marge0avecretrait">&lsquo;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38 &hellip; compatible with Article 12 EC, read in conjunction with Article 39 EC?</p>
      <p class="C09Marge0avecretrait">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to Question 1 is in the negative, does Article 12 EC, read in conjunction with Article 39 EC, preclude national
         rules which exclude Union citizens from receipt of social assistance if the maximum period of residence permitted under Article
         6 of Directive 2004/38 &hellip; has been exceeded and there is no right of residence under other provisions?
      </p>
      <p class="C09Marge0avecretrait">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, does Article 12 EC preclude national rules which exclude nationals of Member
         States of the European Union even from receipt of the social assistance benefits which are granted to illegal immigrants?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point22" shape="rect">22</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By order of the President of the Court of 7 April 2008, Case C&#8209;22/08 and Case C&#8209;23/08 were joined for the purposes of the
         written and oral procedure and of the judgment.
      </p>
      <p class="C04Titre1">&nbsp;<b>The questions referred for preliminary ruling</b></p>
      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>Preliminary observations</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point23" shape="rect">23</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, as regards the division of jurisdiction between the Community judicature and national courts, it is in principle
         for the national court to determine whether the factual conditions triggering the application of a Community rule are fulfilled
         in the case pending before it, the Court, when giving a preliminary ruling, may, where appropriate, provide clarification
         to guide the national court in its interpretation (see, to that effect, Case C&#8209;424/97 <i>Haim</i> [2000] ECR I&#8209;5123, paragraph 58).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point24" shape="rect">24</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is apparent from the orders for reference, the questions referred are based on the premiss that, at the time material to
         the main proceedings, Mr Vatsouras and Mr Koupatantze did not have the status of &lsquo;worker&rsquo; within the meaning of Article 39&nbsp;EC.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point25" shape="rect">25</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referring court found that the &lsquo;brief minor&rsquo; professional activity engaged in by Mr Vatsouras &lsquo;did not ensure him a livelihood&rsquo;
         and that the activity pursued by Mr Koupatantze &lsquo;lasted barely more than one month&rsquo;.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point26" shape="rect">26</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be pointed out in that regard that, according to settled case-law, the concept of &lsquo;worker&rsquo; within the meaning of Article
         39 EC has a specific Community meaning and must not be interpreted narrowly. Any person who pursues activities which are real
         and genuine, to the exclusion of activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary, must
         be regarded as a &lsquo;worker&rsquo;. The essential feature of an employment relationship is, according to that case-law, that for a
         certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives
         remuneration (see, inter alia, Case 66/85 <i>Lawrie-Blum</i> [1986] ECR 2121, paragraphs 16 and 17, and Case C&#8209;228/07 <i>Petersen</i> [2008] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 45).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point27" shape="rect">27</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the origin of the funds from which the remuneration is paid nor the limited amount of that remuneration can have any
         consequence in regard to whether or not the person is a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; for the purposes of Community law (see Case 344/87 <i>Bettray</i> [1989] ECR 1621, paragraph 15, and Case C&#8209;10/05 <i>Mattern and Cikotic</i> [2006] ECR I&#8209;3145, paragraph 22).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point28" shape="rect">28</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the income from employment is lower than the minimum required for subsistence does not prevent the person in
         such employment from being regarded as a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; within the meaning of Article 39 EC (see Case 53/81 <i>Levin</i> [1982] ECR 1035, paragraphs 15 and 16, and Case C&#8209;317/93 <i>Nolte</i> [1995] ECR I&#8209;4625, paragraph 19), even if the person in question seeks to supplement that remuneration by other means of
         subsistence such as financial assistance drawn from the public funds of the State in which he resides (see Case 139/85 <i>Kempf</i> [1986] ECR 1741, paragraph 14).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point29" shape="rect">29</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, with regard to the duration of the activity pursued, the fact that employment is of short duration cannot, in
         itself, exclude that employment from the scope of Article 39 EC (see Case C&#8209;3/90 <i>Bernini</i> [1992] ECR I&#8209;1071, paragraph 16, and Case C&#8209;413/01 <i>Ninni-Orasche</i> [2003] ECR I&#8209;13187, paragraph 25).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point30" shape="rect">30</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, independently of the limited amount of the remuneration and the short duration of the professional activity,
         it cannot be ruled out that that professional activity, following an overall assessment of the employment relationship, may
         be considered by the national authorities as real and genuine, thereby allowing its holder to be granted the status of &lsquo;worker&rsquo;
         within the meaning of Article 39 EC.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point31" shape="rect">31</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the referring court to reach such a conclusion in regard to the activities pursued by Mr Vatsouras and Mr Koupatantze,
         the latter would have been able to retain the status of workers for at least six months, subject to compliance with the conditions
         laid down in Article 7(3)(c) of Directive 2004/38. The national court alone is responsible for factual assessments of this
         kind.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point32" shape="rect">32</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Vatsouras and Mr Koupatantze had retained the status of workers, they would have had the right to benefits such as those
         provided for by the SGB II, in accordance with Article 24(1) of Directive 2004/38, during that period of at least six months.
      </p>
      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>The first question</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point33" shape="rect">33</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this question, the referring court asks whether Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38 is compatible with Article 12 EC, read
         in conjunction with Article 39 EC.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point34" shape="rect">34</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38 establishes a derogation from the principle of equal treatment enjoyed by Union citizens
         other than workers, self-employed persons, persons who retain such status and members of their families, who reside within
         the territory of the host Member State.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point35" shape="rect">35</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under that provision, the host Member State is not obliged to confer entitlement to social assistance on, among others, job-seekers
         for the longer period during which they have the right to reside there.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point36" shape="rect">36</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationals of a Member State seeking employment in another Member State fall within the scope of Article 39 EC and therefore
         enjoy the right to equal treatment laid down in paragraph 2 of that provision (Case C&#8209;258/04 <i>Ioannidis</i> [2005] ECR I&#8209;8275, paragraph 21).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point37" shape="rect">37</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in view of the establishment of citizenship of the Union and the interpretation of the right to equal treatment
         enjoyed by citizens of the Union, it is no longer possible to exclude from the scope of Article 39(2) EC a benefit of a financial
         nature intended to facilitate access to employment in the labour market of a Member State (Case C&#8209;138/02 <i>Collins</i> [2004] ECR I&#8209;2703, paragraph 63, and <i>Ioannidis</i>, paragraph 22).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point38" shape="rect">38</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, legitimate for a Member State to grant such an allowance only after it has been possible to establish a real
         link between the job-seeker and the labour market of that State (Case C&#8209;224/98 <i>D&rsquo;Hoop</i> [2002] ECR I&#8209;6191, paragraph 38, and <i>Ioannidis</i>, paragraph 30).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point39" shape="rect">39</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of such a link can be determined, in particular, by establishing that the person concerned has, for a reasonable
         period, in fact genuinely sought work in the Member State in question (<i>Collins</i>, paragraph 70).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point40" shape="rect">40</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that nationals of the Member States seeking employment in another Member State who have established real links
         with the labour market of that State can rely on Article 39(2) EC in order to receive a benefit of a financial nature intended
         to facilitate access to the labour market.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point41" shape="rect">41</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for the competent national authorities and, where appropriate, the national courts not only to establish the existence
         of a real link with the labour market, but also to assess the constituent elements of that benefit, in particular its purposes
         and the conditions subject to which it is granted.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point42" shape="rect">42</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Advocate General has noted in point 57 of his Opinion, the objective of the benefit must be analysed according to its
         results and not according to its formal structure.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point43" shape="rect">43</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A condition such as that in Paragraph 7(1) of the SGB II, under which the person concerned must be capable of earning a living,
         could constitute an indication that the benefit is intended to facilitate access to employment.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point44" shape="rect">44</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the derogation provided for in Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted in accordance with Article
         39(2) EC.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point45" shape="rect">45</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of a financial nature which, independently of their status under national law, are intended to facilitate access
         to the labour market cannot be regarded as constituting &lsquo;social assistance&rsquo; within the meaning of Article 24(2) of Directive
         2004/38.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point46" shape="rect">46</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the foregoing, the answer must be that, with respect to the rights of nationals of Member States seeking employment
         in another Member State, examination of the first question has not disclosed any factor capable of affecting the validity
         of Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38.
      </p>
      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>The second question</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point47" shape="rect">47</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the answer given to the first question, it is not necessary to answer the second question.
      </p>
      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>The third question</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point48" shape="rect">48</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this question, the referring court asks whether Article 12 EC precludes national rules which exclude nationals of Member
         States of the European Union from receipt of social assistance benefits which are granted to illegal immigrants.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point49" shape="rect">49</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to that question, the referring court cites provisions of the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz, point (1) of Paragraph
         1(1) of which provides that foreign nationals actually residing within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany are
         entitled to those benefits where they possess a temporary residence permit for asylum-seekers.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point50" shape="rect">50</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That question should, therefore, be construed as meaning that the referring court is essentially asking whether Article 12
         EC precludes national rules which exclude nationals of Member States from receipt of social assistance benefits in cases where
         those benefits are granted to nationals of non-member countries.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point51" shape="rect">51</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first paragraph of Article 12 EC prohibits, within the scope of application of the EC Treaty, and without prejudice to
         any provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point52" shape="rect">52</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That provision concerns situations coming within the scope of Community law in which a national of one Member State suffers
         discriminatory treatment in relation to nationals of another Member State solely on the basis of his nationality and is not
         intended to apply to cases of a possible difference in treatment between nationals of Member States and nationals of non-member
         countries.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point53" shape="rect">53</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the third question, therefore, must be that Article 12 EC does not preclude national rules which exclude nationals
         of Member States of the European Union from receipt of social assistance benefits which are granted to nationals of non-member
         countries.
      </p>
      <p class="C04Titre1">&nbsp;<b>Costs</b></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point54" shape="rect">54</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court,
