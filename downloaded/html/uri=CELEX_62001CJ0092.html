         Court of First Instance, Heraklion, Single Judge) referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC a question
         on the interpretation of Articles 8a and 59 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Articles 18 and 49 EC) and Article 3(1)
         of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes

         and development tax which he was required to pay when flying from Heraklion to Marseilles (France).

         does not constitute consideration for a performed service but, rather, a fiscal charge. That tax is used,

         (Greece).

         a distance criterion, establishes a distinction between domestic flights in Greece and international flights, including those
         to other Member States. According to him, that distinction is contrary to Article 8a and Article 59 of the Treaty and to Article
         3 of Regulation No 2408/92. Mr Stylianakis bases his arguments, in particular, on Case C-381/93

         No 2408/92, submits that the flight between Corfu and Rome (Italy), that is to say between Greece and another Member State,
         is less than 750 km and that it is taxable at the lower rate. The Greek State added that passengers on international flights,
         including flights to other Member States, benefit from more extensive services than those on internal flights and that the
         tax difference, which in any event involves small sums, is therefore justified.

            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>The national court nevertheless considers that the doubled tax applicable to flights to Member States other than Greece may
         constitute a restriction of the freedom of movement of citizens of the Union and an infringement of the provisions of Regulation

         a Member State from imposing a differentiated fiscal charge on domestic and intra-Community flights with the direct result
         that an amount of tax is charged on intra-Community flights double that applicable to flights within the Member State?

         State to fulfil its obligations. That case was registered at the Court Registry under the number C-272/00.

         Greece and other Member States or contracting parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 (OJ 1994
         L 1, p. 3), the difference in the amount of airport modernisation and development tax determined in accordance with distance
         and fixed that amount at the equivalent of EUR 12. Accordingly, the Commission withdrew its action and Case C-272/00 was removed

         between Member States but, observing that that tax is applied without discrimination on the grounds of nationality and in
         accordance with an objective criterion, concludes that it is not contrary to Article 59 of the Treaty since that provision
         prohibits only discrimination based on nationality or residence. It further submits that application of the distance criterion
         is not a disguised restriction. It adds that the tax does not infringe Regulation No 2408/92 since payment of that tax is
         not a condition of authorisation to exercise traffic rights.

         </b><dl><dt><b>22
            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>The Commission contends that the tax system at issue in the main proceedings imposes the most onerous tax principally on international
         flights, including those between Member States, because, with one exception, the flights of less than 750 km are domestic
         flights within the territory of Greece. That system makes the provision of air transport services between Member States more
         difficult than the provision of the same services within Greece and is consequently a restriction contrary to Article 59 of
         the Treaty, since that article applies to air transport pursuant to Regulation No 2408/92. The need to finance Sp&aacute;ta airport,
         relied on by the Greek State before the national court, cannot justify such a restriction. The Commission, on the basis of
         its understanding of a document of the Greek Civil Aviation authority (YPA) on passenger-processing capacity in airports,
         disputes the claim that passengers on international flights benefit from more extensive services than those on domestic flights,
         a situation which might have justified the imposition of a higher tax on those passengers. It maintains that, in any event,
         the purpose of the tax at issue in the main proceedings is not to compensate the costs of the services actually provided in
         airports. The Court's answer

         since those services are governed by the provisions of the title relating to transport, the principle of the freedom to provide
         services is none the less applicable to that sector.

            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>As is clear from the case-law of the Court, the very purpose of Regulation No 2408/92, which was adopted on the basis of Article
         84(2) of the Treaty, is to define the conditions for applying in the air transport sector the principle of the freedom to
         provide services (see, to that effect, Case C-361/98  
          <i>Italy</i>  v  
          <i>Commission</i>  [2001] ECR I-385, paragraph 32).

            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>That freedom precludes the application of any national legislation which has the effect of making the provision of services
         between Member States more difficult than the provision of services purely within one Member State, irrespective of whether
         there is discrimination on the grounds of nationality or residence (see, to that effect,  
          <i>Commission</i>  v  
          <i>France</i> , cited above, paragraph 17 to 21).

            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>As regards the tax at issue in the main proceedings, those air journeys which cover a distance of more than 750 km from a
         Greek airport, on which the most onerous tax is imposed, are all journeys between Member States or to third countries, whereas
         those covering a distance of less than 750 km, which are subject to the lower tax, are, with one exception, all domestic flights
         within Greece. It must therefore be held that, despite the ostensible neutrality of the criterion used to differentiate the
         amount of tax imposed, the most onerous tax specifically concerns non-domestic flights (see, by analogy, Case C-205/98  
          <i>Commission</i>  v  
          <i>Austria</i>  [2000] ECR I-7367).

         </b><dl><dt><b>27
            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>Moreover, in the light of the documents before the Court, it does not seem that the tax in question contains an element of
         compensation for airport services necessary for the processing of passengers and that the cost of those services provided
         to passengers on flights of more than 750 km is double that of those provided to passengers on flights of less than 750 km.

         </b><dl><dt><b>28
            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>Accordingly, since airport taxes directly and automatically influence the price of the journey, differences in the taxes to
         be paid by passengers will automatically be reflected in the transport cost, and thus, in the case in the main proceedings,
         access to domestic flights will be favoured over access to intra-Community flights (see Case C-70/99  
          <i>Commission</i>  v  
          <i>Portugal</i>  [2001] ECR I-4845, paragraph 20).

            </b></dt><dd><b></b></dd></dl><b>The answer to the question referred by the national court for a preliminary ruling must therefore be that Article 3(1) of
         Regulation No 2408/92 precludes a measure adopted by a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which
         imposes on, for the most part, flights to other Member States higher airport tax than that applicable to domestic flights
         within that Member State unless it is shown that those taxes compensate airport services necessary for the processing of passengers
         and that the cost of those services provided to passengers flying to other Member States is proportionately higher than the
         cost of those services necessary for the processing of passengers on domestic flights.
