      <p class="S01PointAltN">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Community law stands at present, the right of nationals of a Member State to travel to and reside in another Member State
         is not unconditional. That follows, first, from the provisions on the free movement of persons and services contained in Title
         III of Part Three of the Treaty, namely Articles 39 EC, 43 EC, 46 EC, 49 EC and 55 EC, and the secondary legislation adopted
         to give them effect and, second, from the provisions of Part Two of the Treaty, more specifically Article 18 EC, which, while
         granting citizens of the Union the right to move and reside freely within the Member States, expressly refers to the limitations
         and conditions laid down in the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect. 
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">Where, in proceedings under Article 234 EC, the Court is asked about the compatibility with Community law of a national provision
         which requires the competent authorities to expel nationals of other Member States who have received certain sentences for
         specific offences and the information available to the Court does not enable it to establish with certainty whether the national
         concerned may rely on the provisions of Article 39&nbsp;EC or on other provisions of the Treaty and of secondary legislation on
         the freedom of movement for persons or the freedom to provide services, whereas it is common ground that, as a citizen of
         the Union, the person concerned enjoys, under Article 18 EC, the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the
         Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect,
         it is for the national court to determine the provisions of Community law, if any, other than Article 18(1) EC, on which the
         person concerned may rely.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">In that regard, it is, in particular, for the national court to establish whether the person concerned comes within the scope
         of Article 39 EC, either as a worker, or as a person otherwise entitled, under the provisions of the secondary legislation
         adopted to give effect to that article, to freedom of movement, or whether he may rely on other provisions of Community law,
         such as Directive 90/364 on the right of residence or Article 49 EC, which applies particularly to recipients of services.

      <p class="S01PointAltN">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 3 of Directive 64/221 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals
         which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, which provides that the measures in question
         must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual subjected to them and that previous criminal convictions
         cannot in themselves be grounds for these measures, precludes national legislation which requires national authorities to
         expel nationals of other Member States who have been finally sentenced to a term of youth custody of at least two years or
         to a custodial sentence for an intentional offence against the German Law on narcotics, where the sentence has not been suspended.

         must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual subjected to them and that previous criminal convictions
         cannot in themselves be grounds for these measures, precludes a national practice whereby the national courts may not take
         into consideration, in reviewing the lawfulness of the expulsion of a national of another Member State, factual matters which
         occurred after the final decision of the competent authorities which may point to the cessation or the substantial diminution
         of the present threat which the conduct of the person concerned constitutes to the requirements of public policy. That is
         so, above all, if a lengthy period has elapsed between the date of the expulsion order and that of the review of that decision
         by the competent court.

      <p class="S01PointAltN">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Articles 39 EC and 3 of Directive 64/221 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of

         measures in question must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual subjected to them and that previous
         criminal convictions cannot in themselves be grounds for these measures, preclude national legislation and practices whereby
         a national of another Member State who has received a particular sentence for specific offences is ordered to be expelled,
         in spite of family considerations being taken into account, on the basis of a presumption that that person must be expelled,
         without proper account being taken of his personal conduct or of the danger which he represents for the requirements of public
         policy.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">On the other hand, Article 39 EC and Directive 64/221 do not preclude the expulsion of a national of another Member State
         who has received a particular sentence for specific offences and who, on the one hand, constitutes a present threat to the
         requirements of public policy and, on the other hand, has resided for many years in the host Member State and can plead family
         circumstances against that expulsion, provided that the assessment made on a case-by-case basis by the national authorities
         of where the fair balance lies between the legitimate interests at issue is made in compliance with the general principles
         of Community law and, in particular, by taking proper account of respect for fundamental rights, such as the protection of
         family life.

      <p class="S01PointAltN">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9(1) of Directive 64/221 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign
         nationals which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, the object of which is to ensure
         a minimum procedural safeguard for persons affected by a decision ordering their expulsion from the territory, precludes a
         provision of a Member State which provides neither a complaints procedure nor an appeal, comprising also an examination of
         expediency, against a decision to expel a national of another Member State taken by an administrative authority, where no
         authority independent of that administration has been put in place.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">Where it is not disputed that the review of the expulsion decisions in question is by administrative courts in judicial proceedings,
         but doubt persists as to the extent of that review, it is for the national court to establish whether the courts with jurisdiction
         in such matters are able to consider the expediency of expulsion orders.

         of an administrative act adversely affecting an individual are, as a general rule, reviewed in Germany by the administration
         in a pre-litigation procedure, before an action for annulment is commenced. However, according to the first sentence of Paragraph&nbsp;68(1)
         of the Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung (Code of Administrative Proceedings), a decree, even a regional decree, may derogate from
         that principle. The Land Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg has made use of that possibility in adopting Paragraph&nbsp;6a of the Ausf&uuml;hrungsgesetz
         zur Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung (Law implementing the Code of Administrative Procedure). By virtue of that provision, which
         took effect on 1 July 1999, a pre-litigation procedure is excluded where an administrative act has been adopted by a Regierungspr&auml;sidium.

         in the Land Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, if it is guaranteed that the administration&rsquo;s decision is subject to a detailed review of the
         relevant law within time-limits. It cites, in that regard, <i>Shingara and Radiom</i>, cited above. Protection from expulsion is ensured in that Land under the administrative procedure and its review is guaranteed
         in the context of judicial proceedings. The review carried out by the administrative courts covers, first, the question whether
         the substantive conditions for expulsion are met in law and in fact, including the question whether the competent administration
         has exceeded its discretionary powers, and, secondly, the merits.

         ordering their expulsion from the territory. That article, which applies in three cases, namely where there is no right of
         appeal to a court of law, where such an appeal may be only in respect of the legal validity of the decision, or where the
         appeal cannot have suspensory effect, provides for the intervention of a competent authority other than that empowered to
         take the decision. Save in cases of urgency, the administrative authority may not take its decision until an opinion has been
         obtained from the other competent authority. The person concerned must enjoy such rights of defence before the latter authority
         and of assistance or representation as the domestic law of that country provides for (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-297/88
         and C-197/89 <i>Dzodzi</i> [1990] ECR I-3763, paragraph&nbsp;62, and <i>Yiadom</i>, cited above, paragraphs 29 to 31).

         of the measure in question, before the decision is definitively adopted (<i>Santillo</i>, cited above, paragraph 12, and Joined Cases 115/81 and 116/81 <i>Adoui and Cornuaille</i> [1982] ECR 1665, paragraph 15). The Court has also stated that, save in urgent cases, the administrative authority may not
