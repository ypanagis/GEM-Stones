         <dl><dt>1.</dt><dd></dd></dl> Nationals of one Member State who are lawfully resident in the territory of another Member State may rely on the right set
         out in Article 12&nbsp;EC not to suffer discrimination on grounds of nationality in regard to the rules governing their surname.
         Citizenship of the Union is destined to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States, enabling those nationals
         who find themselves in the same situation to enjoy, within the scope  
          <i>ratione materiae</i>  of the EC&nbsp;Treaty, the same treatment in law irrespective of their nationality, subject to such exceptions as are expressly
         provided for. The situations falling within the scope  
          <i>ratione materiae</i>  of Community law include those involving the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty, in particular
         those involving the freedom to move and reside within the territory of the Member States, as conferred by Article 18&nbsp;EC. Although, as Community law stands at present, the rules governing a person's surname are matters coming within the competence
         of the Member States, the latter must none the less, when exercising that competence, comply with Community law, in particular
         with the Treaty provisions on the freedom of every citizen of the Union to move and reside in the territory of the Member
         States. Citizenship of the Union, established by Article 17&nbsp;EC, is not, however, intended to extend the scope  
          <i>ratione materiae</i>  of the Treaty also to internal situations which have no link with Community law. Such a link with Community law does, however,
         exist in regard to persons in a situation such as that of a national of one Member State who is lawfully resident in the territory
         of another Member State. That conclusion cannot be invalidated by the fact that the persons concerned also have the nationality
         of the Member State in which they have been resident since their birth and which, according to the authorities of that State,
         is by virtue of that fact the only nationality recognised by the latter. It is not permissible for a Member State to restrict
         the effects of the grant of the nationality of another Member State by imposing an additional condition for recognition of
         that nationality with a view to the exercise of the fundamental freedoms provided for in the Treaty. see paras 22-29
         <p></p>
         <dl><dt>2.</dt><dd></dd></dl> Articles 12&nbsp;EC and 17&nbsp;EC must be construed as precluding the administrative authority of a Member State from refusing to grant
         an application for a change of surname made on behalf of minor children resident in that State and having dual nationality
         of that State and of another Member State, in the case where the purpose of that application is to enable those children to
         bear the surname to which they are entitled according to the law and tradition of the second Member State. First, with regard to the principle of the immutability of surnames as a means designed to prevent risks of confusion as to
         identity or parentage of persons, although that principle undoubtedly helps to facilitate recognition of the identity of persons
         and their parentage, it is still not indispensable to the point that it could not adapt itself to a practice of allowing children
         who are nationals of one Member State and who also hold the nationality of another Member State to take a surname which is
         composed of elements other than those provided for by the law of the first Member State and which has, moreover, been entered
         in an official register of the second Member State. Furthermore, by reason in particular of the scale of migration within
         the Union, different national systems for the attribution of surnames coexist in the same Member State, with the result that
         parentage cannot necessarily be assessed within the social life of a Member State solely on the basis of the criterion of
         the system applicable to nationals of that latter State. In addition, far from creating confusion as to the parentage of the
         children, a system allowing elements of the surnames of the two parents to be handed down may, on the contrary, contribute
         to reinforcing recognition of that connection with the two parents. Second, with regard to the objective of integration pursued by the practice in issue, the practice in issue is, in view of
         the coexistence in the Member States of different systems for the attribution of surnames applicable to those there resident,
         neither necessary nor even appropriate for promoting the integration of the nationals of other Member States within their
         State of residence. see paras 42-43, 45, operative part

         the Belgian authorities suggest, in situations such as that in the main proceedings, a change of surname such that children
         adopt only the first part of their father's surname.  Exceptionally, and in particular where there are few connecting factors
         to Belgium, a surname may be conferred in accordance with foreign law, in particular where the family has lived in a country
         other than Belgium in which the child has been registered under the double surname, in order not to affect adversely that
         child's integration.  In recent years, it claims, the administration has adopted a more flexible approach, particularly in
         the case where a first child born under Spanish jurisdiction has a double surname in accordance with Spanish law, whereas
         the second child, which has Belgian and Spanish nationality, bears the double surname of its father in accordance with Article
         335(1) of the Belgian Civil Code, in order to re-establish the same surname within the family.

         an application to change the surname of minor children residing in Belgium who have dual Belgian and Spanish nationality has
         been made on the ground, without other special circumstances, that those children should bear the surname to which they are
         entitled according to Spanish law and tradition, from refusing that change by stating that that type of application  
         is habitually rejected on the ground that, in Belgium, children bear their father's surname, particularly where the position usually adopted by the authority results from the fact that it considers that the grant
         of a different surname may, in the context of social life in Belgium, arouse questions as to the parentage of the child concerned,
         but that, in order to reduce the difficulties associated with dual nationality, it is suggested to applicants in that situation
         that they adopt only the father's first surname, and that, exceptionally, where there are few connecting factors to Belgium

         argues that the infringement of the rights of the children of the applicant in the main proceedings is reduced inasmuch as
         those children can in any event rely on their Spanish nationality and the surname conferred in accordance with Spanish law
         in every Member State other than Belgium.  The practice in issue makes it possible to avoid risks of confusion as to identity

         who are nationals of one Member State and who also hold the nationality of another Member State to take a surname which is
         composed of elements other than those provided for by the law of the first Member State and which has, moreover, been entered
         in an official register of the second Member State.  Furthermore, it is common ground that, by reason in particular of the
         scale of migration within the Union, different national systems for the attribution of surnames coexist in the same Member
         State, with the result that parentage cannot necessarily be assessed within the social life of a Member State solely on the
         basis of the criterion of the system applicable to nationals of that latter State.  In addition, far from creating confusion
         as to the parentage of the children, a system allowing elements of the surnames of the two parents to be handed down may,
         on the contrary, contribute to reinforcing recognition of that connection with the two parents.
