         intention of seeking paid employment there and applies for a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is not a worker for the purposes of Title
         II of Part I of Regulation No 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community, as amended by Regulation No
         2434/92.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">In that title of Regulation No 1612/68, the term &lsquo;worker&rsquo; covers only persons who have already entered the employment market
         and who therefore may, on the basis of Article 7(2) of the regulation, claim the same social and tax advantages as national
         workers.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">In the absence of a sufficiently close connection with the employment market in the host Member State, the position of the
         abovementioned person must be compared with that of any national of a Member State looking for his first job in another Member
         State without having yet entered into an employment relationship there, who benefits from the principle of equal treatment
         only as regards access to employment.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">Where national legislation makes grant of such an allowance to a person conditional on his being a worker for the purposes
         of Regulation No 1612/68, it is, however, for the national court or tribunal to establish whether the term &lsquo;worker&rsquo; referred
         to by the legislation is to be understood in the sense of Title II of Part I to the regulation.

         Directive 68/360 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States
         and their families.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">The right of residence in a Member State referred to in Articles 4 and 8 of Directive 68/360 is accorded only to nationals
         of a Member State who are already in employment in the first Member State, to the exclusion of persons seeking employment,

         which makes entitlement to a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance conditional on a residence requirement, in so far as that requirement may
         be justified on the basis of objective considerations that are independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and

         remuneration (see, in particular, Case 66/85 <i>Lawrie-Blum</i> [1986] ECR 2121, paragraphs 16 and 17, <i>Mart&iacute;nez Sala</i>, paragraph 32, and Case C-337/97 <i>Meeusen</i> [1999] ECR I&#8209;3289, paragraph 13).

         the host Member State cannot be made conditional on the satisfaction of a condition when such a condition is not applied to
         nationals of the host Member State. Mr Collins acknowledges that the habitual residence test is applied to United Kingdom

         two months following his arrival in that Member State and that he was lawfully resident there in his capacity as a person
         seeking work. As a citizen of the Union lawfully residing in the United Kingdom, he was clearly entitled to the protection
         conferred by Article 6 of the Treaty against discrimination on grounds of nationality in any situation falling within the
         material scope of Community law. That is precisely the case with regard to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which should be considered
         to be a social advantage within the meaning of Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1612/68.

         to a reasonable period and that Mr Collins&rsquo; right to rely on Articles 6 and 8 of the Treaty in order to claim the allowance,
         on the same basis as United Kingdom nationals, is therefore similarly restricted to that period of lawful residence.

         can be more easily met by nationals of the host Member State than by those of other Member States. Whilst such a requirement
         may be justified on objective grounds necessarily intended to avoid &lsquo;benefit tourism&rsquo; and thus the possibility of abuse by
         work-seekers who are not genuine, the Commission notes that in the case of Mr Collins the genuine nature of the search for
         work is not in dispute. Indeed, it appears that he has remained continuously employed in the United Kingdom ever since first
         finding work there shortly after his arrival.
