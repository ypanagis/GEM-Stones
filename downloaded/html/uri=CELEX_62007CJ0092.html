         the free movement of workers, including those relating to the substantive and/or procedural conditions governing the first
         admission to the territory of that Member State of Turkish nationals intending to exercise that freedom.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">Consequently, the standstill rules laid down in Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement
         and in Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 are applicable, from the entry into force of those provisions, to all the charges imposed
         on Turkish nationals for the issue of residence permits concerning a first admission to the territory of that Member State
         or for the extension of such a permit.

         to those imposed on nationals of Member States for the issue of similar documents, and by applying that system to Turkish
         nationals who have a right of residence in a Member State on the basis of the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement, the Additional
         Protocol to that Association Agreement or Decision No&nbsp;1/80 of the EEC-Turkey Association Council, a Member State fails to
         fulfil its obligations under Article&nbsp;9 of the Association Agreement, Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol and Articles&nbsp;10(1)
         and 13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">It is not impossible that charges applicable to Turkish nationals, slightly higher than those claimed from citizens of the
         Union for the issue of similar documents, may, in certain specific instances, be considered proportionate. However, when the
         amounts of the contested charges vary within a range in which the lowest amount is more than two-thirds higher than that of
         the charges applied to citizens of the Union for the issue of similar documents, such a difference cannot be regarded as minimal
         and, consequently, the view must be taken that the contested charges are disproportionate in their entirety.
      </p>
      <p class="S19Marge1">By applying to Turkish nationals charges of a disproportionate amount for obtaining a residence permit or the extension of
         one in comparison with the charges applied to citizens of the Union for similar documents, a Member State, by so doing, imposes
         charges of a discriminatory nature. To the extent to which those charges are applied to Turkish workers or members of their
         family, they introduce a discriminatory condition of work contrary to Article&nbsp;10 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80. In so far as those charges
         are applied to Turkish nationals wishing to avail themselves of freedom of establishment or freedom to provide services pursuant
         to the Association Agreement, or to members of their family, they are contrary to the general rule of non&#8209;discrimination laid
         down in Article&nbsp;9 of the Association Agreement.

      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point14" shape="rect">14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission brought infringement proceedings following a complaint made during 2003 by a Netherlands national living with
         a Turkish national.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point15" shape="rect">15</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24 January 2005, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which replied to it by
         letter of 31 May 2005. As it was not in agreement with the legal analysis of that Member State, the Commission sent to it,
         on 10 April 2006, a reasoned opinion calling on it to take the measures necessary to ensure compliance within a period of
         two months of receipt. The Kingdom of the Netherlands replied to that reasoned opinion on 9&nbsp;June 2006.

      <p class="C04Titre1">&nbsp;<b>The action</b></p>
      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>Arguments of the parties</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point19" shape="rect">19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission claims that the charges imposed on Turkish nationals from 1&nbsp;February 1994 until the end of the period in the
         reasoned opinion for obtaining and extending a residence permit (&lsquo;the contested charges&rsquo;) are contrary to the standstill and
         non-discrimination rules contained in the European Union legislation concerning the EEC-Turkey Association.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point20" shape="rect">20</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contested charges, the Commission argues, infringe the standstill rules because they constitute new measures which have
         worsened the situation of Turkish nationals with regard to the charges to be paid for a residence permit. Those persons were
         not subject, previously, to the obligation to pay such charges and the amounts of those charges have, moreover, been increased
         on a number of occasions since 1994.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point21" shape="rect">21</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is of the view that the contested charges are contrary to Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80, with regard to the
         free movement of workers, to Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol, concerning freedom of establishment and freedom to
         provide services, and to Article&nbsp;9 of the Association Agreement and Article&nbsp;10(1) of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 with regard to the prohibition
         of discrimination.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point22" shape="rect">22</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Commission, Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 applies even if workers and members of their family are still
         not integrated in the host Member State and, consequently, cannot rely on the provisions of Article&nbsp;6(1) of that decision.
         Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol precludes any worsening of the possibilities for establishment and offering services
         to enable the persons concerned to exercise the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point23" shape="rect">23</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission contends that, according to the case-law of the Court, standstill clauses have direct effect and relate also
         to the right of residence. In its observations on the Federal Republic of Germany&rsquo;s statement in intervention, the Commission
         contends that the judgment in Case C&#8209;16/05 <i>Tum and Dari</i> [2007] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;7415, delivered after the reply and rejoinder had been lodged, confirms its analysis. It states that, in that
         judgment, the Court held that the standstill rules apply to every new restriction, whether the restriction in question arises
         from a substantive or a formal rule, and that those rules are not subject to a <i>de minimis</i> threshold.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point24" shape="rect">24</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission contends that, with regard to freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, it is necessary to
         compare the situation as of 1&nbsp;February 1994 with that obtaining when the Additional Protocol entered into force, that is to
         say, on 1&nbsp;January 1973, and, with regard to the free movement of workers, with the situation as of 1 December 1980 or 20 December
         1976, depending on whether Decision No&nbsp;1/80 or the previous decision, Decision No&nbsp;2/76, concerning the implementation of Article&nbsp;12
         of the Association Agreement, adopted by the Association Council on 20&nbsp;December 1976, is taken as the basis.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point25" shape="rect">25</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission acknowledges that the standstill rules do not affect the right of Member States to regulate the first admission
         of Turkish nationals to their territory and the conditions for the pursuit of their first professional activity. It also states
         that there are limits to those standstill rules, namely that which results from Article&nbsp;59 of the Additional Protocol, under
         which Turkish nationals may not benefit from rights more favourable than those granted to citizens of the Union, and that
         which results from application of the rules against discrimination. Even if account is taken of those rules, however, the
         Netherlands legislation is still contrary to the standstill rules.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point26" shape="rect">26</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the rules against discrimination, the Commission contends that Article&nbsp;10(1) of Decision No&nbsp;1/80, which prohibits
         discrimination as to conditions of work, is applicable because the charges required of Turkish nationals when submitting an
         application for a residence permit constitute a condition of work. According to the judgment in Case C&#8209;171/01 <i>W&auml;hlergruppe Gemeinsam</i> [2003] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;4301, paragraph&nbsp;57, the rule of equal treatment laid down in Article&nbsp;10 imposes an obligation as to results.
         In addition, even if that article were not applicable, the contested charges would have to be held to be discriminatory under
         Article&nbsp;9 of the Association Agreement, which prohibits discrimination in general.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point27" shape="rect">27</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing before the Court, the Commission indicated that it took formal notice of the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>, cited above, in which the Court examined whether charges such as those applied to Turkish nationals during 2002 complied
         with the standstill rule in Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80, basing itself on the concept of proportionality and assessing
         whether or not those charges were disproportionate in comparison with those applied to nationals of Member States for the
         issue of similar documents. The Commission takes the view that the concept of &lsquo;higher charges&rsquo;, to which it refers in the
         form of order sought in its application, includes &lsquo;disproportionate charges&rsquo; and can be understood in that sense.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point28" shape="rect">28</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its defence, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, having noted an uncertainty as to the scope of the failure to fulfil obligations,
         conceded at the hearing that the application related not only to the charges in respect of the extension of the residence
         permits but also to the charges associated with the first issue of those permits.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point29" shape="rect">29</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Netherlands also indicated that it took formal notice of the judgments delivered after it had lodged its
         rejoinder, that is, the judgments in <i>Tum and Dari</i>, in Case C&#8209;228/06 <i>Soysal and Savatli</i> [2009] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;1031, and in <i>Sahin</i>. It recognises, consequently, that the standstill rules concern not only the substantive rules but also the formal rules
         and that they apply to the rights of Turkish nationals from the time of their first admission to the territory of the Member
         States in the areas of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. By contrast, it takes the view that the standstill
         rules referred to in Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 do not apply to the first admission of Turkish workers to a Member State.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point30" shape="rect">30</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as Turkish workers are concerned, the Kingdom of the Netherlands contends that the question whether there is a right
         of residence depends on whether there is a right of access to the labour market of the Member State of destination pursuant
         to Articles 6 and 7 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80. Only Turkish nationals who have entered the territory of a Member State legally and
         who belong to the regular labour market of that State, together with members of their family, have a right of residence in
         that Member State. Other Turkish workers do not benefit from a right of residence under Decision No&nbsp;1/80, but remain subject
         to the national immigration rules of the Member State in which they wish to reside.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point31" shape="rect">31</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning, next, the amount of the charges applied to Turkish nationals for the grant of a residence permit, the Kingdom
         of the Netherlands indicated at the hearing before the Court that it had reduced the amount of those charges with effect from
         17&nbsp;September 2009. Those charges, it submits, are no different from those applicable to citizens of the Union for the issue
         of similar documents, save in the case of a first admission for the purposes of establishment or of the provision of services
         and in the case of a first admission as a worker, the difference being more substantial in the second of those cases. 
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point32" shape="rect">32</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the amount of the contested charges, the Kingdom of the Netherlands contends that it is justified. It relies, by way
         of analogy, on the judgment in Case C&#8209;327/02 <i>Panayotova and Others</i> [2004] ECR I&#8209;11055, concerning the Europe Agreements establishing associations between the European Communities and their
         Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, the Republic of Poland and the Slovak Republic, of the other
         part. It refers to paragraph 20 of that judgment, in which the Court held that the restrictions imposed on the right of establishment
         by the host Member State&rsquo;s immigration legislation must be appropriate for achieving the objective in view and must not constitute,
         with regard to that objective, measures which would strike at the very substance of the rights granted. The Kingdom of the
         Netherlands states that it is necessary to verify, in the same way, that the contested charges do not make the exercise by
         Turkish nationals of the rights conferred on them by the Association Agreement impossible or excessively difficult. It adds
         that those charges must be non-discriminatory and proportionate, compliant with fundamental rights and reasonable in their
         amount.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point33" shape="rect">33</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Netherlands contends that the contested charges share those characteristics.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point34" shape="rect">34</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those charges, it argues, in no way undermine the substance of the right, recognised by Decision No&nbsp;1/80, of access to the
         labour market, given that they do not constitute a new substantive condition necessary for obtaining the right of residence
         which that decision grants to Turkish nationals, but a simple formal requirement for the establishment by the Netherlands
         authorities that that right of residence exists.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point35" shape="rect">35</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contested charges, it submits, are not discriminatory since there are fundamental differences between the situation of
         Turkish nationals and that of citizens of the Union. The Association Agreement does not create an internal market with the
         Republic of Turkey and does not confer citizenship of the Union on Turkish nationals. The Commission is thus attempting, wrongly,
         to extend to Turkish nationals the provisions of Directive 2004/38.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point36" shape="rect">36</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contested charges are not disproportionate, given that Turkish nationals wishing to immigrate to a Member State normally
         have sufficient means to pay those charges. Persons interested may, if necessary, borrow the amounts required.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point37" shape="rect">37</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do the contested charges undermine fundamental rights. In addition, the Netherlands Parliament provided for an exemption
         in favour of foreign nationals able to rely on Article&nbsp;8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
         Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4&nbsp;November 1950, concerning the right to respect for private and family life, in cases
         where they are unable to pay the contested charges.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point38" shape="rect">38</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of those charges, it is submitted, is reasonable. The charges are based on an analysis of the cost price of producing
         the documents issued and amendments have been made to the amounts charged in order to take account of the latest cost studies.
         Turkish nationals pay no more than 70% of the costs generated by processing applications for residence permits, 30% of those
         costs being met by the State.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point39" shape="rect">39</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Netherlands adds that the Commission accepts that Member States may move from a system of nominal charges
         to a system under which the charges reflect more closely the costs involved. That is exactly what the Kingdom of the Netherlands
         did by establishing a correlation between the amount of the contested charges and the cost price of producing the documents
         the issue of which is sought.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point40" shape="rect">40</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, that Member State maintained, at the hearing before the Court, that the head of complaint formulated by the Commission
         in its application, alleging that the amount of the contested charges is &lsquo;higher&rsquo; than that applied to nationals of the Member
         States, does not correspond to the criterion of proportionality taken into account by the Court in <i>Sahin</i>. Accordingly, it contends that the present action is unfounded.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point41" shape="rect">41</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Republic of Germany has intervened in support of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It contends that the contested
         charges are connected with an administrative formality and do not amount to a restriction for the purposes of the standstill
         rules. In any event, those charges may be justified by an overriding general-interest ground, namely, the need to monitor
         the inflow of foreign nationals and the reasons why they wish to reside in the host Member State.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point42" shape="rect">42</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Republic of Germany further contends that the anti-discrimination rule laid down in Article&nbsp;9 of the Association
         Agreement is not sufficiently clear and precise for it to be directly applicable. It argues that that rule must be given more
         specific form by other measures, such as Article&nbsp;10 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80. Article&nbsp;10, however, is not applicable to the present
         case because the contested charges do not form part of the conditions of work within the meaning of that article.
      </p>
      <p class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<i>Findings of the Court</i></p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point43" shape="rect">43</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to note at the outset that, in the form of order sought in its application, the Commission requests that the
         Court declare that, by introducing and maintaining, for the issue of residence permits to Turkish nationals with the right
         of residence in the Netherlands, a system providing for higher charges than those imposed not only on nationals of Member
         States but also on nationals of the Republic of Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway and the
         Swiss Confederation for the issue of similar documents, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has failed to fulfil its obligations
         under European Union law. However, the European Union legal texts on which the Commission bases its action do not refer to
         those latter four States. Consequently, the comparison with those States must be disregarded.
      </p>
      <p class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;The application of the standstill rules to the first admission of a Turkish national to the territory of the Kingdom of the
         Netherlands
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point44" shape="rect">44</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Commission, the standstill rules apply to the contested charges, whether they concern an application for
         a residence permit relating to a first admission to the Netherlands of a Turkish national or an application to extend such
         a permit. The Kingdom of the Netherlands acknowledges that the standstill rules apply to the rights of Turkish nationals,
         as from their first admission to the territory of the Member States in the areas of freedom of establishment and freedom to
         provide services, but it contends that they do not apply to the first admission of Turkish workers to that territory.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point45" shape="rect">45</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, the Court examined in <i>Sahin</i> the scope of the standstill rule laid down in Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80, applicable to free movement of workers. It
         held that that provision is not intended to protect Turkish nationals already integrated into a Member State&rsquo;s labour force,
         but is intended to apply precisely to Turkish nationals who do not yet qualify for the rights in relation to employment and,
         accordingly, residence under Article&nbsp;6(1) of that decision (<i>Sahin</i>, paragraph 51).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point46" shape="rect">46</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court also examined Article&nbsp;13 in the light of the standstill rule in Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol, concerning
         freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point47" shape="rect">47</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Article&nbsp;41(1), the Court held, in accordance with the judgments in <i>Tum and Dari</i> and <i>Soysal and Savatli</i>, that that provision prohibits the introduction, as from the date of entry into force of the legal act of which that provision
         forms part in the host Member State, of any new restrictions on the exercise of freedom of establishment or freedom to provide
         services, including those relating to the substantive and/or procedural conditions governing the first admission to the territory
         of that Member State of Turkish nationals intending to make use of those economic freedoms (<i>Sahin</i>, paragraph 64).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point48" shape="rect">48</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court ruled that, as the standstill clause in Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 is of the same kind as that contained in
         Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol, and as the objective pursued by those two clauses is identical, the interpretation
         of Article&nbsp;41(1) must be equally valid as regards the standstill obligation which is the basis of Article&nbsp;13 in relation to
         freedom of movement for workers (<i>Sahin</i>, paragraph&nbsp;65).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point49" shape="rect">49</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 precludes the introduction into Netherlands legislation, as from the date on
         which Decision No&nbsp;1/80 entered into force in the Netherlands, of any new restrictions on the exercise of the free movement
         of workers, including those relating to the substantive and/or procedural conditions governing the first admission to the
         territory of that Member State of Turkish nationals intending to exercise that freedom.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point50" shape="rect">50</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the standstill rules laid down in Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol and in Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80
         are applicable, from the entry into force of those provisions, to all of the charges imposed on Turkish nationals for the
         issue of residence permits concerning a first admission to the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands or for the extension
         of such a permit.
      </p>
      <p class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;The existence of a failure to fulfil obligations resulting from the standstill rules</p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point51" shape="rect">51</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Commission and the Kingdom of the Netherlands both contend that the existence of the failure to fulfil obligations
         alleged must be assessed in the light of the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>, their views differ on the consequences to be drawn from that judgment. According to the Commission, that failure is based
         on the fact that that Member State has imposed on Turkish nationals charges which are disproportionate when compared with
         those applied to citizens of the Union for the issue of similar documents. The concept of disproportionate charges, it argues,
         must be understood as being included within the concept of higher charges referred to in the form of order sought in the application.
         
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point52" shape="rect">52</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it follows from <i>Sahin</i> that the application to Turkish nationals of charges which are not exactly equal to those applied to citizens of the Union
         is not contrary to the standstill rules and that disproportionate charges alone are prohibited by those rules. The charges
         imposed on Turkish nationals, however, represent only a part of the costs relating to the examination of their files and are
         thus not contrary to those rules. Moreover, that Member State takes the view that the action concerns the application to Turkish
         nationals, not of disproportionate charges, but of higher charges than those applied to citizens of the Union and that, therefore,
         the action is unfounded.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point53" shape="rect">53</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, for the purposes of examining the present action, it is necessary to refer to the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>, in which the Court ruled on the compatibility with Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 of charges such as those imposed during
         2002 by Netherlands legislation for the issue of a residence permit or its extension. The charges applied to Turkish workers
         amounted, in that case, to EUR&nbsp;169 for the extension of a residence permit, compared with the charge of only EUR&nbsp;30 which,
         according to the referring court in that case, was required from citizens of the Union for the issue of residence papers.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point54" shape="rect">54</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>, in particular from paragraphs 72 and 74, that the application for a residence permit or for the extension of the validity
         of such a document presented by a Turkish national and the application for the issue of a residence permit presented in another
         Member State by a citizen of the Union are similar.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point55" shape="rect">55</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court held that legislation, such as the Netherlands legislation, must not amount to creating, with regard to Turkish
         nationals, a restriction within the meaning of Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80. It stated that, read in conjunction with Article&nbsp;59
         of the Additional Protocol, Article&nbsp;13 implies that, although a Turkish national to whom those provisions apply must certainly
         not be placed in a position more advantageous than that of citizens of the Union, he cannot, on the other hand, be subjected
         to new obligations which are disproportionate as compared with those established for those citizens (<i>Sahin</i>, paragraph 71).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point56" shape="rect">56</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court found that the financial impact of charges such as those introduced in 2002 is significant for Turkish nationals,
         the more so as those Turkish nationals are required to apply for renewal of their residence permits more frequently than citizens
         of the Union and, if their application is rejected, the sum paid is not reimbursed. The Court concluded that the Netherlands
         Government had not advanced any relevant argument capable of justifying such a significant difference between the charges
         imposed on Turkish nationals and those charged to citizens of the Union. It did not accept the argument of the Netherlands
         Government that the enquiries and checks required before a residence document can be issued to a Turkish national are more
         complex and more costly than those needed for the issue of a residence permit to a citizen of the Union.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point57" shape="rect">57</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court concluded that legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings constituted a restriction prohibited by
         Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 to the extent to which, for the purposes of examination of an application for the grant of
         a residence permit or an extension thereof, the legislation requires payment, by Turkish nationals to whom Article&nbsp;13 applies,
         of charges in an amount which is disproportionate in comparison with that demanded in similar circumstances from citizens
         of the Union (see <i>Sahin</i>, paragraph 72 to 74).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point58" shape="rect">58</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to take those developments into account in the present case, which relates to all of the charges applied to
         Turkish nationals by Netherlands legislation since 1994 for the granting and extension of residence permits, as amended in
         particular during 2002, 2003 and 2005, and summarised in the table set out in paragraph 13 above.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point59" shape="rect">59</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with that noted during 2002 at issue in the case leading to the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>, the difference between the amounts of the charges applied to Turkish nationals and those imposed on citizens of the Union
         increased further during 2003 and 2005. Moreover, the Turkish nationals concerned by the present action are not only workers,
         as in <i>Sahin</i>, but also persons wishing to avail themselves of freedom of establishment or freedom to provide services under the Association
         Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point60" shape="rect">60</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a failure to comply with the standstill rules must thus be examined in the light of the rules laid down in
         Article&nbsp;13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80 and in Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point61" shape="rect">61</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it is common ground that the contested charges constitute new measures since they were adopted after the entry
         into force of Decision No&nbsp;1/80, in so far as they affect the situation of Turkish workers, and after the entry into force
         of the Additional Protocol, in so far as they concern Turkish nationals wishing to avail themselves of freedom of establishment
         or freedom to provide services under the Association Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point62" shape="rect">62</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the imposition of any new measure in that context is not prohibited. The adoption of measures which apply in the
         same way to both Turkish nationals and citizens of the Union is not inconsistent with the standstill rules. If such measures
         applied to nationals of Member States but were not also imposed on Turkish nationals, Turkish nationals would be placed in
         a more favourable position than citizens of the Union, which would be clearly contrary to the requirement laid down in Article&nbsp;59
         of the Additional Protocol, under which the Republic of Turkey may not receive more favourable treatment than that which Member
         States grant to one another pursuant to the EC Treaty (see, to that effect, <i>Soysal and Savatli</i>, paragraph&nbsp;61, and <i>Sahin</i>, paragraph&nbsp;67).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point63" shape="rect">63</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, therefore, to determine whether the contested charges impose on Turkish nationals new obligations which are
         disproportionate in relation to those provided for citizens of the Union.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point64" shape="rect">64</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it acknowledges that the charges previously applied were too high, the Kingdom of the Netherlands contends that the
         amount of the charges applicable to Turkish nationals can be explained by the higher costs involved in processing their files.
         In that regard, it should be pointed out that, in paragraph&nbsp;73 of the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>, the Court did not take the view that that ratio justified such a difference, which it found to be significant, between the
         charges applied to Turkish nationals and those imposed on citizens of the Union for the issue of similar documents.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point65" shape="rect">65</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the argument of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that the contested charges represent 70% of the costs of processing files
         is not capable of justifying their application and that Member State&rsquo;s assertion that those charges are not disproportionate
         must be rejected.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point66" shape="rect">66</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Netherlands also contends that the contested charges are non-discriminatory because differences exist,
         which it classifies as fundamental, between the situation of Turkish nationals and that of citizens of the Union. According
         to that Member State, the fundamental objective of the European Union, which is to establish an internal market, put in place
         European citizenship and ensure the free movement of citizens within the Union, cannot be applied &lsquo;in an unlimited way&rsquo; to
         Turkish nationals.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point67" shape="rect">67</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must, however, be stated that, as follows from Article&nbsp;2(1) of the Association Agreement, that agreement has the objective
         of bringing the situation of Turkish nationals and citizens of the Union closer together through the progressive securing
         of free movement for workers and the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point68" shape="rect">68</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, the general principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, laid down in Article&nbsp;9 of the Association
         Agreement, and the application of that principle to the specific field of workers, in accordance with Article&nbsp;10 of Decision
         No&nbsp;1/80, contribute to facilitating the progressive integration of migrant Turkish workers and Turkish nationals who move
         for the purposes of establishment or in order to provide services in a Member State (see, to that effect, with regard to workers,
         <i>W&auml;hlergruppe Gemeinsam</i>, paragraph&nbsp;78).
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point69" shape="rect">69</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Netherlands cannot therefore justify the difference existing between the contested charges and those required
         from citizens of the Union by referring to the circumstance that free movement of workers, freedom of establishment or freedom
         to provide services in the Union do not benefit Turkish nationals as completely as they benefit citizens of the Union. The
         Commission correctly relied on the non-discrimination rules as well as on Article&nbsp;59 of the Additional Protocol for the purpose
         of verifying whether the contested charges did not make the situation of those nationals worse in comparison with that of
         citizens of the Union, in a manner which was contrary to the standstill rules.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point70" shape="rect">70</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of the Netherlands maintains, moreover, that there is a distinction between the concept of higher charges referred
         to in the Commission&rsquo;s application and that of disproportionate charges in the judgment in <i>Sahin</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point71" shape="rect">71</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it must be stated that the first of those concepts includes the second and that not all higher charges are
         necessarily disproportionate.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point72" shape="rect">72</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to a question at the hearing concerning the implications of that distinction in the present case, the Kingdom
         of the Netherlands contended that the charges applied to Turkish nationals could be slightly higher than the charges applied
         to citizens of the Union if the actual costs of processing the files of the former are higher than those of processing the
         files of the latter. It contended in particular that the charges applied to Turkish nationals, from 17&nbsp;September 2009, comply
         in full with the condition of proportionality.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point73" shape="rect">73</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the charges applied with effect from that date, it must be pointed out that these were introduced after the period
         laid down in the reasoned opinion. It is settled case-law that the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its
         obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in that Member State at the end of the period laid
         down in the reasoned opinion, and the Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes (see, inter alia, Case C&#8209;168/03
         <i>Commission</i> v <i>Spain</i> [2004] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;8227, paragraph&nbsp;24, and judgment of 3&nbsp;June 2008 in Case C&#8209;507/07 <i>Commission</i> v <i>France</i>, not published in the ECR, paragraph&nbsp;7). Consequently, those charges cannot be taken into account by the Court for the purposes
         of examining the present action for failure to fulfil obligations.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point74" shape="rect">74</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the contested charges, it cannot be ruled out that the charges applicable to Turkish nationals, slightly higher than
         those claimed from citizens of the Union for the issue of similar documents, may, in certain specific instances, be considered
         proportionate. However, the amounts of the contested charges vary within a range in which the lowest amount is more than two-thirds
         higher than that of the charges applied to citizens of the Union for the issue of similar documents. Such a difference cannot
         be regarded as being minimal and, consequently, the view must be taken that the contested charges are disproportionate in
         their entirety.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point75" shape="rect">75</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is also of the view that the contested charges are contrary to the non-discrimination rules set out in Article&nbsp;9
         of the Association Agreement and Article&nbsp;10(1) of Decision No&nbsp;1/80. In that regard, it is necessary to state that, by applying
         to Turkish nationals charges of a disproportionate amount for obtaining a residence permit or the extension of one in comparison
         with the charges applied to citizens of the Union for similar documents, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, by so doing, imposed
         charges of a discriminatory nature. To the extent to which those charges are applied to Turkish workers or members of their
         family, they introduce a discriminatory condition of work contrary to Article&nbsp;10 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80. In so far as those charges
         are applied to Turkish nationals wishing to avail themselves of freedom of establishment or freedom to provide services pursuant
         to the Association Agreement, or to members of their family, they are contrary to the general rule of non-discrimination laid
         down in Article&nbsp;9 of the Association Agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><a name="point76" shape="rect">76</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, by introducing and maintaining a system for the issue of residence permits providing for charges which are
         disproportionate in relation to those imposed on nationals of Member States for the issue of similar documents, and by applying
         that system to Turkish nationals who have a right of residence in the Netherlands on the basis of the Association Agreement,
         the Additional Protocol or Decision No&nbsp;1/80, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article&nbsp;9
         of the Association Agreement, Article&nbsp;41(1) of the Additional Protocol and Articles&nbsp;10(1) and 13 of Decision No&nbsp;1/80.
